        <h2>What am I doing now?</h2>
        <p>I currently work for a tech company as an Account Manager. I engage with many different IT
          professionals to help understand and solve various technical challenges. This role has given exposure to
          many different technical concepts and roles, and as a result inspired me to get involved and learn how to code!
        </p>
        <h2>Why do I want to get into tech?</h2>
        <p>I began to teach myself to code and quickly realised this was something I really enjoyed and would love
          to be able to do as a career. I decided to enroll in a bootcamp to continue my learning and gain the technical skills
          needed for a career in tech. I love the process of learning new concepts and being able to apply my knowledge and creativity to solve problems.
        </p>
        <h2>What have I learned so far?</h2>
        <p>I'm currently three months into the bootcamp. These are some of the languages and concepts learned so far:
